I couldn't get Heroku to work, I tried 3-4 times to no avail. I think it's because when I launch the server port the opening page/index page doesn't actually show anything. I think it's an issue in the routes.db tab, but it appears to match the tacostagram final routes.db tab. So i'm not really sure why it isn't indexing to the places page, but I think that's why it isn't working in Heroku.
